Hi, I’m Shamya!

👀 This github repo is basically just me developing my own personal homelab and websites. Kind of just seeing what random apps i can/should run and show that i have the capability to do so.

Current sites:
shamya.net
grafana.shamya.net
status.shamya.net

Next projects:
K3s via Terraform and Ansible, running the Prometheus stack, Grafana, etc, on Proxmox as bare metal.
Currently getting GitHub Actions on my 3rd proxmox node so that I can do this all remotely without using a vpn.

I'm a mild nerd. 

Email me and check out my sick Youtube channel where I go through setting up a full 3 node cluster of K3s.
