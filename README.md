- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shamya!
- ðŸ‘€ This github repo is basically just me developing my own personal website for greater exposure to all the various aspects that hosting and editing a website entail. 
Please do visit my site (currently) https://test.shamya.net and there you can find my network topology map that shows how i use proxmox + NGINX to host this website, as well as using the powerful abilties of pfSense to bolster this task and a lot more.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a tech enthusiast with a hands-on approach to experimenting with IT software and hardware, 
                           whether itâ€™s at work or at home. I thrive on the challenge of combining 
                           top-notch customer service with IT expertise, turning complex issues into 
                           seamless operations. From ServiceNow to PowerShell, Exchange Support, patching, 
                           and diving into virtualization with VMWare ESXI and Proxmox, I've been tinkering 
                           and making sure systems work and are at peak efficiency. Now, I'm eager to bring 
                           my unique blend of experience and tech enthusiasm to contribute to making systems 
                           and processes the best they can be.
