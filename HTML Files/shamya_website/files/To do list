DONE ---- I've got to fix the font's not being picked up. Probably will have to download the fonts again or properly/remove the api link.

DONE ---- Remove the mailto "my email" as chrome inpspect is showing it as an error/bad.

DONE ---- Make the two email name and address fields autocomplete. So add an auto complete attribute to these. in the form <!-- <form autocomplete="on">

Fix the form to use smtp scripts to send an email to myself. Keila? phpmailer? Etc.

DONE ---- Need to clean up the code and auto format it.

-Form elements do not have associated labels, the comment section in the form doesn't have a label i think. 

- <html> element does not have a [lang] attribute

- Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio. Might have to experiment with some colours.

I've removed the mailto to stop the error.
Renamed the css to style1.css and the ref to it as style1.css in the index file which fixed the fonts. The server side (on cloudflare) had cached the old style css.
Added the autocomplete="on" to the form.

Unified the repo code and the server code. 
Fixed the auto complete on both inputs.
Fixed all the I's (were lowercase cause old tradition from using iv vi stuff apparently) lol.
Fixed a typo 'physical'.
Auto formatted the code, shift + alt + f and got rid of comments that were redundant.
