                       <!-- Add that i'm Aus born-->
                       <p> Where do i begin? I was born in Sydney, and i grew up having to fix all the new and failing tech around me; leading me down a trajectory <!-- maybe hole?--> that would shape the rest of my life.
                        This all eventually led me down the path of becoming a natural when it came to tech, as well as just having a knack and desire for 
                        troubleshooting things, whether it be phycial or digital. 
                        </br>
                    </br>
                        Through my earlier online retail endeavor at Myer, where i mentored every new person 
                        (including managers), to my IT experience at my current role at NTT, i've obtained an all 
                        rounded skillset that gives me the ability to learn fast and excel in my work. 
                        Luckily i can pair this with my outgoing and happy nature, which is evidently quite rare in the IT industry, so if you - the reader, ever talk to me, 
                        you'll hear me laugh quite a bit and i'll likely digress a lot like i am in this sentence. Hope you find this page intriguing, enjoy, and please find my work experience in the menubar up top as well as contact details, cheers! 


<!-- Easter egg, this was my original about me paragraph, but i found it a bit too robotic if you know what i mean.
                           I’m a tech enthusiast with a hands-on approach to experimenting with IT software and hardware, 
                           whether it’s at work or at home. I thrive on the challenge of combining 
                           top-notch customer service with IT expertise, turning complex issues into 
                           seamless operations. From ServiceNow to PowerShell, Exchange Support, patching, 
                           and diving into virtualization with VMWare ESXI and Proxmox, I've been tinkering 
                           and making sure systems work and are at peak efficiency. Now, I'm eager to bring 
                           my unique blend of experience and tech enthusiasm to contribute to making systems 
                           and processes the best they can be.  -->

                        I'd like to say my network topology is coming along nicely, but many would find my use of a 
                        virtual router uneasy, though it's been working perfectly for over a year now with 
                        over <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/result/15907143557"> 900mbps down</a> and 3 ping!
                       </br></br>                      
                        I setup this website via an Nginx server that i'm running on my second Proxmox cluster, with 
                        my SSL certs being handled by ACME certs and proxied by HAProxy via my pfsense vm to Cloudflare, so 
                        my network isn't exposed to the internet (as long as Cloudflare is still operational ahah).
                        I also recently setup my own email service, so i can receive emails to the @shamya.net domain, so feel free to 
                        email <a href="mailto:contact@shamya.net">contact@shamya.net</a> if you want to help test out my email capacity!
                        My next project will likely be setting up TrueNas (i need a good NAS) or Nextcloud as a private cloud storage alternative. 
                        Feel free to recommend any projects that i might find interesting, i'm always down to explore!

                        I'm working on my website (the site you're on), as well as setting up my own email server (shamya@shamya.net domain can now receive emails/send emails).
                       
                       The next project i'll work on is setting up TrueNas scale or Nextcloud (maybe both). I need a good consolidated backup server basically, preferably gapped/offsite in some way at least.

                    Above is my Network Topology, some info is obfuscated for opsec, even though subnet info and vlan info wouldn't actually threaten my network if they got leaked for obvious reasons.

                                        Worked for Myer Chatswood's Online Fulfilment team for over 5 years and through a wide range of technical changes.
                                        I was able to manage a team of around 30 team members at a time as a shift team leader, through Black Friday sales and Boxing day orders.
                                        I managed all the Warehouse Management Sytems for order picking while delegating roles for the staff on shift.                                        
                                        Myer was a memorable place, where i made a lot of valuable connections and gained wholly beneficial skills for life.

                Their own website is missing so many things like a proper Youtube api key, comments, old links, not working links, 
                it's twitter account is spamming things that look sus etc. Might get rid of this footer since the site it directs to is lacking in updates.-->
